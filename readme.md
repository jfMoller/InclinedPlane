## About this project:

I find it helpful to draw models when doing math, I wanted to build a visual model of the inclined plane that could act as a resource in addition to standard calculations.
The model visually represents the vectors that arise as a box is placed on the inclined plane. I wanted to represent the ratios between the forces dynamically, in response to changes in the plane’s geometry. I also wanted to show when the box would start sliding due to its vectors, as well as the shape and friction of the plane.

## Controls:
The height/angle of the plane can be changed with the [W] & [S] keys, [Shift] can be held to allow for a more fractional change. All input fields aside from the angle of the plane can be clicked and changed within certain numeric constraints.

## Constraints:
Were used as an attempt to maintain fidelity and visibility of the model.
* Box mass (m): 0-100 kg
* Gravitational acceleration (g): 9.82 – 13.59 ms^2,
* Coefficient of friction (μ): 0-4 (dimensionless – no unit)
