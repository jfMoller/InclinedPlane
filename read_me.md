## About this project:

I wanted to build a visual model for calculations of the inclined plane, I was interested in creating a something that could act as a visual teaching or learning tool.
The calculations cover the forces that arise as a box is placed on the plane. I wanted to represent the ratios between the forces dynamically with changes to the planes geometry, as well as show through animation when the box, depending on the models values, would start sliding from its initial position.

## controls:

The height of the plane can be changed with the [W] & [S] keys, [Shift] can be held to allow for fractional change. All input fields aside from the angle of the plane can be clicked and changed, with some numeric contraints.
